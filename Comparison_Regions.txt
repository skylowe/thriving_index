Introduction
Recent projects from the University of Nebraska–
Lincoln Bureau of Business Research have bench-
marked economic growth and resources in the
state’s two largest metropolitan areas — Lincoln,
Neb., and Omaha, Neb. Research into the sources
of growth has examined how growth is influenced
by amenities enjoyed by both business and
households and linkages between industries
located throughout the state.

Now, the Rural Futures Institute (RFI) at the
University of Nebraska (NU) has convened and
funded an expanded research team from the
University of Nebraska–Lincoln, the University
of Nebraska at Kearney and Nebraska Extension
Community Vitality Initiative to bring this analysis
to all regions of Nebraska.

The first initial report was delivered online and in
print in 2019. Now the second edition of this report
was released in August 2020. Funding to sustain this
work is a top priority.

Ultimately, the goal is to provide community and
state leaders with the ability to compare Nebraska
regions with like peers located primarily in other
states to better understand where a particular region
excels or lags and to create action where needed.
