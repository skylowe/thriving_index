LETTER FROM PROJECT TEAM

The 2022 Nebraska Thriving Index provides economic developers, local elected officials and community
leaders with economic outcome and resource indicators to identify thriving and lagging regions, support
policy decisions and economic development strategies, and answer the basic question: “How is our
economy doing?” In all, there are 47 individual measures. The Nebraska Thriving Index is calculated for
eight non-metropolitan or small metropolitan regions of Nebraska, including all counties outside of the
Omaha and Lincoln metropolitan areas.

The 2022 Nebraska Thriving Index marks the third year that the index has been developed and released.
The 2022 edition includes the same measures that were used in the 2020 Nebraska Thriving Index and
the revised 2019 Nebraska Thriving Index. There is an online interactive comparison tool
(RuralProsperityNE.unl.edu/thriving-index) that allows for year-to-year comparisons.

Compared to 2020, the 2022 Nebraska Thriving Index result show that four of the eight non-
metropolitan and small metropolitan regions improved by one ranking. These include the Panhandle,
Sandhills, Siouxland, and Tri-Cities regions. Three regions – the North 81, Northeast, and Southeast –
maintained their 2020 ranking in 2022. The Southwest region was the only Nebraska region to drop in
ranking.

When examining the regional patterns, we identified three areas of strength: growth, quality of life, and
social capital. That is, across all the eight Nebraska regions, the average rank for these areas was at or
above 3rd place. There are also three areas of concern: infrastructure & cost of doing business,
education and skill, and other prosperity. Across all the eight Nebraska regions, the average rank for
these areas was below 4th place.

Although each region has its own strengths and concerns, overall, the Nebraska regions are performing
well relative to similarly situated peer regions. Five of the eight regions rank at the 3rd place or above
with North 81 and Tri-Cities ranking 1st.

We hope you enjoy this latest version of the Nebraska Thriving Index.

Sincerely,

The Nebraska Thriving Index Project Team

THRIVING INDEX COMPONTENT MEASURES and DETAILS
Nebraska regions are compared with peers according to three indexes of economic prosperity and five
indexes of economic conditions.

Economic Prosperity Indexes

The Growth Index includes multiple measures of growth, primarily over the 2017 to 2020 period,
including growth in total employment, private employment, growth in private wages per job, growth in
households with children, and growth in dividends, interest and rent income. Table 1 includes measure
descriptions.

THRIVING INDEX REGIONS and COMPARISON REGIONS
The Nebraska regions (Figure 1) were selected in an iterative process, which considered Nebraska
Extension’s Community Vitality Initiative Accountability Regions, Nebraska Economic Development
Regions, Nebraska Economic Development Districts, information from the Nebraska Department of
Labor and the expertise of project participants.

Douglas, Sarpy, Cass, Saunders, Washington, Lancaster and Seward counties are not included in any of
the eight regions. Benchmarking comparisons for these metropolitan areas have been produced by the
Bureau of Business Research in reports for the Greater Omaha Chamber and the Lincoln Partnership for
Economic Development.

Western and central Nebraska regions largely follow Nebraska Economic Development Districts, as seen
in the regional definitions for the Panhandle, Sandhills and Southwest regions. The Tri-Cities region also
largely follows the Nebraska Economic Development District definition and contains the counties of the
Grand Island metropolitan area, the Kearney micropolitan area, the Hastings micropolitan area and
surrounding counties. The Southeast region excludes the Lincoln metropolitan area but includes
adjacent counties as well as counties bordering Kansas, Iowa and Missouri. The Siouxland region
includes Dakota and Dixon counties, which are part of the Sioux City, Iowa, metropolitan area. The North
81 region includes the counties within the Norfolk and Columbus micropolitan areas. Adjacent counties
to the east were not part of the North 81 as these are influenced by the Omaha and Sioux City
metropolitan areas. The Northeast region includes these counties as well as counties directly north and
west of the North 81 region.

Each Nebraska region was compared to a set of benchmarking regions, either other Nebraska regions or
U.S. Economic Development Administration regions located in another northern Plains state such as
Iowa, South Dakota, Kansas, Minnesota, (western) Illinois, (northern) Missouri, (eastern) Colorado and
(eastern) Wyoming. Benchmarking regions were not selected in an ad hoc manner but via the
Mahalanobis matching technique. The technique compares all regions according to the fundamental
economic characteristics of each region such as total population, economic structure (ratio of farm
revenue to total personal income, ratio of ranch revenue to total personal income, and manufacturing
share of employment), and urban orientation (percent of population in a micropolitan area, distance to
a small MSA (population <250,000) and distance to a large MSA (population >250,000)). A list of 5 to 8
benchmarking regions was selected based on the similarity according to these characteristics.

2022 RESULTS: REGIONAL RESULTS
Figure 2 shows the aggregate index value and rank for each of the eight Nebraska regions within their
respective peer group in the 2022 Nebraska Thriving Index. The aggregate index value is the average of
eight component indexes. Three indexes reflect measures of economic prosperity: the Growth Index,
the Economic Opportunity & Diversity Index and the Other Prosperity Index. Five indexes reflect the
underlying economic conditions, that is, economic resources and sources of comparative advantage.
These are the Demographic Growth & Renewal Index, the Education & Skill Index, the Infrastructure &
Cost of Doing Business Index, the Quality of Life Index and the Social Capital Index.

A Thriving Index value of 100 means that the Nebraska region is at the average value of its peers, while a
value of 0 means that a Nebraska region is one standard deviation behind its peers and a value of 200
means that a Nebraska region is one standard deviation ahead of its peers.

The micropolitan and small metropolitan North 81 and Tri-Cities regions both rank 1st among their
peers. North 81 has a 2022 Nebraska Thriving Index value of 130 indicating that, on average, across all
measures North 81 is 0.30 standard deviations above its peers. The Tri-Cities region is 0.31 standard
deviations above its peers.

Three other non-metropolitan Nebraska regions had index values near their peer average. The
Northeast region had an index value of 105 and ranked 2nd among its peers. The Sandhills region had a
2022 Nebraska Thriving Index value of 105 and ranked 3rd among its peers. The Southeast region, which
had an index value of 99, ranked 4th.

The remaining three Nebraska regions ranked lower among their peers and had 2022 Nebraska Thriving
Index values below their peer average. The Panhandle and Siouxland regions had index values of 76 and
73, respectively. These indicate that on average, the Panhandle and Siouxland regions are about one-
quarter of a standard deviation below their peers. The Southwest region had an index value of 82 and
ranked near the lowest of all regions among its peers at 6th of seven places.

Several patterns emerge when the statewide average ranking of each component index is considered.

Strengths
Nebraska regions are relatively strong for the Growth Index, the Quality of Life Index, and the Social
Capital Index. That is, the average rank for this index is at or above 3rd place.

Strength #1: Growth
Nebraska regions from the Tri-Cities to the eastern border of the state had the highest ranks and values
for the Growth Index (see Figure 3). The North 81, Northeast, Southeast, and Tri-Cities regions all ranked


                                                                                                               11
1st among their peers for growth and the Siouxland region ranked 2nd. Regions in the western part of
the state (Panhandle, Sandhills, and Southwest) were below the peer average and the Panhandle ranked

Concerns
Nebraska regions are relatively weak for the Infrastructure & Cost of Doing Business Index, Education &
Skill Index, and the Other Prosperity Index. That is, the average rank for these indexes is below 4th
place.

Concern #1: Infrastructure & Cost of Doing Business
A majority of Nebraska regions are below their peer average for the Infrastructure & Cost of Doing
Business Index, with the Siouxland region one standard deviation below its peer average and the
Sandhills region two-thirds of a standard deviation below its peer average. On the positive side, the
Northeast, Southwest, and Tri-Cities regions have values above 100 and rank either 2nd or 3rd among
their peers (see Figure 6).

Concern #2: Education & Skill
Most regions of Nebraska are below their peer average for the Education & Skill Index. The Siouxland
and Southwest regions are nearly one standard deviation below their peers and rank last among their
peers. The Southeast, Panhandle and Tri Cities regions have index values below 100 and rank at or
below the 4th place ranking. On the positive side, the North 81, Northeast, and Sandhills regions have
Education & Skill Index values above 100 and rank 2nd among their peers (see Figure 7).

Concern #3: Other Prosperity
All of Nebraska’s regions, except for the Tri-Cities, are below their peer average for the Other Prosperity
Index. The Siouxland region is more than one-and-a-half standard deviations below its peer average and
ranks last. The Panhandle and Southwest regions rank last or second last and are more than one-half of
a standard deviation below their peer average. The Northeast region has the highest ranking at 3rd
place but is below 100 (see Figure 8).

Figure 10 shows the value and ranking of the Nebraska Thriving Component Indexes for the North 81
region compared to its peers. The North 81 region’s 1st place ranking and 130 value on the aggregate
2022 Nebraska Thriving Index is driven by strong performance in several of the economic prosperity
indexes and the economic conditions indexes. Specifically, the North 81 region performs well relative to
its peers on one of the three economic prosperity indexes, ranking 1st for the Growth Index. For the
economic conditions indexes, the North 81 region performs well on four of the five measures, ranking
1st for the Quality of Life Index and 2nd for the Demographic Growth & Renewal, Social Capital, and
Education & Skill Indexes.

NORTHEAST REGION
The Northeast region includes the counties directly to the west and north of the Columbus and Norfolk
micropolitan areas, as well as counties along the eastern border of Nebraska between the Sioux City and
Omaha metropolitan areas. The Northeast region and peers receive a large share of income from
farming and ranching and have a large share of employment in manufacturing. There are five peer
comparison regions for the Northeast region including two Nebraska regions. The Nebraska regions are
the Southwest and Panhandle regions. The remaining three comparison regions are located in Iowa.
(See Figure 19.)

Figure 20 shows the value and ranking of the Nebraska Thriving Component Indexes for the Northeast
region compared to its peers. The Northeast region’s 2nd place ranking and 105 value on the aggregate
2022 Nebraska Thriving Index is driven by strong performance in several of the economic prosperity
indexes and the economic conditions indexes. Specifically, the Northeast region performs well relative
to its peers on two of the three economic prosperity indexes, ranking 1st for the Growth Index and 3rd
for the Other Prosperity Index. Demographic Growth & Renewal, Infrastructure & Cost of Doing Business
and Education & Skill are other areas of strength for the Northeast region as it ranks 2nd and 3rd for
these indexes.

Considerations
An area of consideration would be identified as the Northeast region ranking 4th among its peers and
having neither an area of strength or concern. However, the Northeast region did not have a 4th place
ranking on any of the eight Nebraska Thriving Component Indexes.

Concerns
This section focuses on the underlying indicators of the Nebraska Thriving Component Indexes where
the Northeast region is recognized as having an area of concern. An area of concern is identified as the
Northeast region ranking in one of the bottom two of six places among its peers.

Economic Opportunity & Diversity Index
The Northeast region ranks 5th among its peers and is more than one-half of a standard deviation below
the peer region average for the Economic Opportunity & Diversity Index, which measures
entrepreneurial activity, industry and occupation diversity and telecommuting. Although the Northeast
region ranks 3rd on industry diversity, it ranks much lower on the remaining six of seven indicators,
particularly those related to the business and entrepreneurial environment (see Figure 26).

PANHANDLE REGION
The Panhandle region contains the eleven most western Nebraska counties and includes the Scottsbluff-
Gering micropolitan area as well as Alliance, Chadron, and Sidney. Nearly half of the regional population
resides in a micropolitan area and ranching is a key component of the production economy. There are
six peer comparison regions for the Panhandle region, including peer regions located in the state of
Nebraska. The Nebraska peers are the Northeast, Southwest and Tri-Cities regions. The other
comparison regions are located in Wyoming (1), Colorado (1) and Iowa (1). (See Figure 29.)

Figure 30 shows the value and ranking of the Nebraska Thriving Component Indexes for the Panhandle
region compared to its peers. The Panhandle region’s 5th place ranking and 76 value on the aggregate
2022 Nebraska Thriving Index is due to poor performance in several of the economic prosperity indexes
and economic conditions indexes. Specifically, the Panhandle region is weak compared to its peers on
two of the three economic prosperity indexes measures, ranking 6th for the Other Prosperity Index and
last for the Growth Index. Other areas of poor performance for the Panhandle region are Education &
Skill and Demographic Growth & Renewal as it ranks 5th for these two indexes. On a positive note, the
Panhandle region ranks 2nd on the Economic Opportunity & Diversity Index and the Social Capital Index
and 3rd on the Quality of Life Index and Infrastructure & Cost of Doing Business Index

Index Interpretation
<100 = BELOW the average of its peers
 100 = AT the average of its peers
>100 = ABOVE the average of its peers
Example: A value of 156 for Social Capital indicates that social capital is 0.56 of a standard deviation
above the average social capital among the peer regions.

Strengths
This section focuses on the underlying indicators of the Nebraska Thriving Component Indexes where
the Panhandle region is recognized as having an area of strength. An area of strength is identified as the
Panhandle region ranking in one of the top three of seven places among its peers.

Economic Opportunity & Diversity Index
The Panhandle region ranks 2nd among its peers and is above the peer average for the Economic
Opportunity & Diversity Index, which measures entrepreneurial activity, industry and occupation
diversity and telecommuting. Within this index, the Panhandle region ranks 2nd or 3rd for four of the
seven indicators, and 4th for the remaining indicators (see Figure 31).

Infrastructure & Cost of Doing Business Index
The Panhandle region ranks 3rd among its peers and is slightly below the peer average for the
Infrastructure & Cost of Doing Business Index, which measures the cost of operating businesses in a
region. Within this index, the Panhandle region ranks 1st on weekly wage rate which indicates that
Panhandle region employers pay relatively lower wage rates than employers in similarly situated peer

SANDHILLS REGION
The Sandhills region contains the non-metropolitan counties of North Central Nebraska including Cherry,
Holt, and Custer Counties. There are no micropolitan areas in the Sandhills region and ranching and
tourism are key components of the regional economy. There are five peer comparison regions for the
Sandhills region, including peer regions located in the state of Nebraska. The Nebraska peers are the
Panhandle, Southwest, and Northeast regions. The other comparison regions are located in Kansas (1)
and Iowa (1). (See Figure 39.)

Figure 40 shows the value and ranking of the Nebraska Thriving Component Indexes for the Sandhills
region compared to its peers. The Sandhills region’s 3rd place ranking and 105 value on the aggregate
2022 Nebraska Thriving Index is due to a mixed performance in several of the economic prosperity
indexes and the economic conditions indexes. Specifically, the Sandhills region performs well relative to
its peers on one of the three economic prosperity indexes. It ranks 1st for the Economic Opportunity &
Diversity Index and is more than one standard deviation above the peer average. Social Capital and
Education & Skill are other areas of strength for the Sandhills region as it ranks 1st and 2nd for these
indexes, respectively. However, areas of poor performance for the Sandhills region are Growth, Quality
of Life, Infrastructure & Cost of Doing Business, and Demographic Growth & Renewal as it ranks 5th or
last for these indexes.

Figure 50 shows the value and ranking of the Nebraska Thriving Component Indexes for the Siouxland
region compared to its peers. The Siouxland region’s 4th place ranking and 73 value on the aggregate
2022 Nebraska Thriving Index is due to poor performance in two of the economic prosperity indexes as
well as two economic conditions indexes. Specifically, the Siouxland region is weak compared to its
peers for the Other Prosperity Index and Economic Opportunity & Diversity Index. Other areas of poor
performance for the Siouxland region are Education & Skill and Infrastructure & Cost of Doing Business,




                                                  42
as it ranks last on these indexes. On a positive note, the Siouxland region ranks 1st for both the
Demographic Growth & Renewal Index and the Quality of Life Index and ranks 2nd for the Growth Index.

SOUTHEAST REGION
The Southeast region excludes the Lincoln metropolitan area but includes adjacent counties as well as
counties bordering the nexus of Kansas, Iowa and Missouri. Many counties in the Southeast region
benefit from commuting flows with the Lincoln metropolitan area, and Otoe County within the region
also benefits from a commuting relationship with the Omaha metropolitan area. The Southeast region is
manufacturing-oriented. There are eight peer comparison regions for the Southeast region, all located
outside of the state of Nebraska. The comparison regions are located in Iowa (5), Minnesota (2) and
South Dakota (1). (See Figure 59.)

Figure 60 shows the value and ranking of the Nebraska Thriving Component Indexes for the Southeast
region compared to its peers. The Southeast region’s 4th place ranking and 99 value on the aggregate
2022 Nebraska Thriving Index is due to a mixed performance in several of the economic prosperity
indexes and the economic conditions indexes. Specifically, the Southeast region performs well relative
to its peers on one of the three economic prosperity indexes, ranking 1st for the Growth Index. Social
Capital is another area of strength for the Southeast region as it ranks 3rd for this index. However, areas
of poor performance for the Southeast region are Economic Opportunity & Growth, Other Prosperity,
Infrastructure & Cost of Doing Business, and Education & Skill, as it ranks 6th or lower for these indexes.

Figure 70 shows the value and ranking of the Nebraska Thriving Component Indexes for the Southwest
region compared to its peers. The Southwest region’s 6th place ranking and 82 value on the aggregate
2022 Nebraska Thriving Index is due to mixed performance in several of the economic prosperity

                                                  55
indexes and the economic conditions indexes. Specifically, the Southwest region performs well relative
to its peers on one of the three economic prosperity indexes, ranking 2nd for the Economic Opportunity
& Diversity Index. Infrastructure & Cost of Doing Business, Quality of Life, and Social Capital are other
areas of strength for the Southwest region as it ranks 2nd and 3rd for these indexes, respectively.
However, areas of poor performance for the Southwest region are Other Prosperity, Demographic
Growth & Renewal, and Education & Skill, as it ranks at or below the 6th place for these indexes.

Figure 80 shows the value and ranking of the Nebraska Thriving Component Indexes for the Tri-Cities
region compared to its peers. The Tri-Cities region’s 1st place ranking and 131 value on the aggregate
2022 Nebraska Thriving Index is driven by strong performance in several of the economic prosperity
indexes and the economic conditions indexes. Specifically, the Tri-Cities region performs well relative to
its peers on two of the three economic prosperity indexes, ranking 1st for the Growth Index and 2nd for
the Economic Opportunity & Diversity Index. Demographic Growth & Renewal, Quality of Life, and
Infrastructure & Cost of Doing Business are other areas of strength for the Tri-Cities region as it ranks 1st
and 3rd for these indexes.

Considerations
This section focuses on the underlying indicators of the Nebraska Thriving Component Indexes where
the Tri-Cities region is identified as having neither an area of strength or concern. An area of
consideration is identified as the Tri-Cities region ranking 4th among its peers.

The Tri-Cities region ranks 4th among its peers for the Other Prosperity Index, which measures life span,
non-wage sources of income, income stability and the poverty rate. Within this index, the Tri-Cities
region ranks 1st and 2nd for the share of income from dividends, interest and rent income and non-farm

                                                     66

region average. Although the region ranks 2nd for labor force participation, the region ranks 4th for
college attainment, 5th for both the share of the workforce in knowledge occupations (e.g., STEM
occupations, financial occupations, management occupations, teachers and health care occupations)
and associate’s degree attainment, and 6th for high school attainment (see Figure 88).

Concerns
An area of concern would be identified as the Tri-Cities region ranking in one of the bottom three of
seven places among its peers. However, the Tri-Cities region did not have a ranking below 4th place on
any of the eight Nebraska Thriving Component Indexes.
