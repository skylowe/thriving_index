I want to replicate the Thriving Index project described in Thriving_Index.pdf and Comparison_Regions.pdf. A previous version of the index calculations and data are provided in Thriving_Index_Calculations.xlsx. I want you to use these three files as guidance as you replicate the project in an R program. When possible, easily available public data mentioned in the documentation that can be accessed via API should prioritize API usage. Any needed API keys can be found in the .Renviron file in the thriving_index directory. For data that is not easily available via API or other methods, you should create fake data that can be used until the actual data can be obtained. Create a detailed project plan and put this in an md file in the thriving_index directory. This project plan should be updated over time as the plan changes and grows larger in scope. Then create an agents.md file that provides guidance and other important information for ChatGPT Codex, Claude Code, or another LLM. The variables to be implemented in the analysis should be described in the project plan. The structure of the repo should also be described in the project plan. Make sure the agents.md file is detailed. It would be ideal if the LLM can try to create this project, run tests, and see it through to completion - only asking questions when it isn't able to figure something out. The gitrepo directory is called thriving_index. All R packages used should be installed and loaded from directory "/home/skylowe/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.3.3". Please include that in the agents.md file.

After you have created the plan and agents md files give me a chance to review them and provide feedback. Do you understand the task?
